                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">You’ve probably seen some impressive videos of FPV (First Person
                                    View) drones flying around tight obstacles or following a dirt bike as the rider
                                    launches off a dirt ramp. If you’re like me, then those videos make you excited to
                                    get out there and try filming similar shots yourself. However, there are some
                                    important things to consider before you jump into the FPV world with both feet.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This article is meant to act as a guide for beginner FPV drone
                                    enthusiasts. If you are researching FPV and trying to make a decision about whether
                                    or not to make the plunge, then you are in the right place. </p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Should I buy a DJI-type drone or get an FPV drone
                                    instead?</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Probably the most important question to ask yourself before you
                                    start making any purchases. To answer this, you need to know the answer to three
                                    other questions: What is my intent/purpose for buying a drone? What is my budget
                                    (really)? How much time do I have to invest in drones? We will get to the last two
                                    questions later, but let’s answer the first question now. </p>
                                <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">What is my intent/purpose for buying a drone?</h3>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Some activities that people use these drones for are weddings, <a
                                        href="https://www.azdronephotography.com/">real estate photography</a>,
                                    vlogging, nature photography, and sometimes for family events. Depending on which
                                    model you get, you can make some professional-grade footage from these drones.</p>
                                <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">FPV Drone</h3>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> FPV drones are built for high-speed activities. They all have
                                    built-in cameras (that transmit the video signal to your goggles), but these are
                                    usually only to assist the pilot in flying and are low-quality. That means that you
                                    need to have an additional camera mounted on top to record anything useful. There
                                    are many options that we won’t go into here, but one of them is to use an action
                                    camera like the GoPro <a
                                        href="https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero10-black-bones/CHDBO-101-master.html">GoPro
                                        Hero 10 Black Bones</a>. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Pilots use these drones for racing, capturing fast-moving objects
                                    like cars, nature flybys, architecture flythroughs, or for freestyle/acrobatic
                                    sessions. These drones are “unlocked”, so to speak. They can perform maneuvers like
                                    flips and rolls that normal drones can’t. </p>
                                <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Something in-between</h3>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Luckily, there is a third option for drone enthusiasts that want
                                    to be able to fly FPV yet still have a normal drone too. The DJI FPV Drone merges
                                    the two together for the first time. This drone is fast and you can toggle FPV
                                    flying mode on and off at will. There is even an emergency air brake button that
                                    will stop your drone and hover at any time. Of course, anything like this is going
                                    to have some concessions. For example, the camera isn’t as good as many other DJI
                                    models and you can say goodbye to repairing this drone yourself if you crash it.
                                    However, this is a great option for beginners who want a taste of FPV. </p>
                                <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../assets/img/fpv-drone.png"

                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">How much does an FPV drone cost?</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">You can buy a good pre-built FPV drone or build one yourself for
                                    $200 - $350. However, that doesn’t account for the entire FPV system. Besides the
                                    drone itself, you need to buy a lot more equipment to start flying such as goggles,
                                    a transmitter, batteries, and battery chargers. A conservative estimate would be
                                    about $1000 to start flying from scratch. Add a few hundred more to that if you want
                                    to get the best equipment. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">A good piece of advice for first-timers is to make a list of all
                                    the parts you are going to need and look up prices before you buy anything. For some
                                    reason it always seems to be more expensive than you originally think, and that may
                                    be a big deciding factor for you. There are several parts guides out there that can
                                    help give you a better idea for prices. </p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Are FPV drones hard to fly?
                                </h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The short answer is yes, they are difficult to fly. You can’t
                                    expect to power on the drone for the first time and fly it around well. Everyone in
                                    the community will tell you that you are going to crash your drone several times,
                                    especially while practicing to fly. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> The good news is that FPV drones are usually easy to repair. If
                                    you aren’t good with your hands, then you’ll have to brush up on some soldering
                                    skills to do this, but it’s nothing too complicated and there are several videos out
                                    there that walk you through it.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Also, there are simulators available on the internet to practice
                                    flying before you even get in the air. The prices for these are cheap and average
                                    around $15 - $20. Check out this list of <a
                                        href="https://oscarliang.com/fpv-simulator/">FPV simulators</a> for more
                                    details. I chose to purchase Velocidrone and have been pretty happy with it so far.
                                </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> What you should takeaway from this section is that you are going
                                    to need to invest time into learning to fly (and possibly learning to repair). I
                                    think that almost anyone can master flying a normal drone in an hour. However, you
                                    are probably going to spend 5+ hours in the simulator alone before you are even
                                    ready to take-off for real. </p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Decision Time</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Hopefully this article has been a valuable part of your research
                                    journey and that you are now able to make a decision about which type of drone you’d
                                    like to buy. Check out my other FPV articles or stay tuned for more content to help

                                            never be private enterprise. Because the space frontier is dangerous, and
                                            it's expensive, and it has unquantified risks.

                                                    When you put money directly to a problem, it makes a good headline.
