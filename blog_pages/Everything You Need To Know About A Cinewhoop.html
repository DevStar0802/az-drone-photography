                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">What is a cinewhoop?</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Cinewhoop is a type of <a
                                        href="./Beginners Guide to FPV Part 1.html">FPV</a> drone designed specifically
                                    for the
                                    purpose of filming close to people, objects, and other obstacles - even flying
                                    indoors. They are built to withstand contact with objects while flying to avoid
                                    damage to either party. The design was first created by Andy Shen, owner of Shen
                                    Drones. He shared his first model with Paul Nurkkala who coined the term
                                    “cinewhoop”. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Since then, it’s grown into an industry-recognized term and other
                                    manufacturers have copied the ducted design. </p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Cinewhoop Design</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Perhaps the most striking difference between a cinewhoop and other
                                    freestyle drones is the whoop frame. These quads have their props enclosed by ducts
                                    to prevent damage to the drone when it comes in contact with other objects. Ducts
                                    used for these frames are typically lightweight and sometimes coated with an
                                    additional layer of foam for extra cushion. These ducts also serve as a protection
                                    to whatever the drone is flying around, particularly people.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This feature is why cinewhoops are exclusively used in making
                                    videos where FPV pilots fly above, under, or near people. It is also the drone of
                                    choice when flying indoors. Exposed props present a safety hazard in these
                                    circumstances and few people would be comfortable with you flying a drone like
                                    whizzing around their head or inside their luxury property. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">A popular trend happening in the FPV world is filming indoor drone
                                    tours. This involves using a drone to film the space inside of a property, typically
                                    in a single take. Because of the extra protection provided by the enclosed props,
                                    pilots can film these videos without worrying about damaging the property should
                                    they brush up against a wall. </p>
                                <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../assets/img/dji-avata.jpg"
                                        alt="the DJI Avata drone in flight" /></figure>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Advantages and disadvantages?</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">One of the disadvantages to flying a cinewhoop is a loss of speed
                                    or power from the motors. The ducted design does protect the props and motors, but
                                    it also creates lower efficiency. This is why most race drones are not ducted. You
                                    will also notice that the common 5 inch quads that many pilots use for flying in
                                    nature are also non-ducted. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Besides being slower, cinewhoops also use up battery power faster.
                                    Pilots can expect batteries to last for a lower flight time when compared to
                                    traditional FPV quads. This disadvantage in flight time is important to consider if
                                    you are wanting to fly for long distances or trying to film something that is
                                    relatively far away.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Lastly, wind is a big problem for cinewhoops. They are easily
                                    buffeted by wind and have a hard time fighting it. My advice is to never fly these
                                    outside if the wind conditions  are anything more than a gentle breeze.</p>
                                <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded"
                                        src="../assets/img/orange-cinewhoop.jpg"
                                        alt="An orange cinewhoop drone flying" /></figure>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Build vs Buy?</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The decision to build or buy a cinewhoop is an important one that
                                    applies to any type of quad. Cinewhoops are not much more difficult to work with
                                    than a normal quad. One aspect to the build that is unique to cinewhoops is the
                                    choice of material for the ducts. Some are made of plastic, foam, or a mixture of
                                    both. Be sure to take into account where you think you’ll be flying and the
                                    obstacles present when you make this decision on material.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Another customization choice for these builds is the height of the
                                    ducts. Traditionally, cinewhoop ducts were tall or deep. More recently,
                                    manufacturers have created ducts that are short or shallow - just barely covering
                                    the props with enough protection to survive a bump against a wall.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The advantage of tall ducts is that they offer a little bit more
                                    protection from any stray objects like tree branches that might damage the props.
                                    However, they are slower than the shallow ducts. I personally believe that the
                                    benefits of greater speed and less weight from the shorter ducts is far more
                                    desirable than the minor increase in protection. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">If you don’t want to get your hands dirty soldering wires and
                                    fiddling with tiny screws, there are plenty of bind and fly (BNF) models out there
                                    that do a great job. DJI even released their own version of a cinewhoop that is more
                                    beginner friendly and has added features such as the ability to hover in place and
                                    obstacle avoidance. Here are a just a few options if you are interested in comparing
                                    some models:</p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">How to Tune?</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">There is no difference in the process for adjusting the tune of
                                    these drones as any other quad. I recommend using Betaflight to do this. The one
                                    difference that you can capitalize on is tuning your quad to be slower and smoother
                                    for filming more cinematic shots. After all, this is the prime reason why you should
                                    build a ducted quad - So why wouldn’t you want to slow those movements down to
                                    increase control and minimize jerkiness? I recommend watching a youtube video to
                                    guide you through the process and get you as close as possible to the right feel. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Note - don’t expect to go zipping around corners and performing
                                    high speed tricks after you do this. Your quad will be more boring and sluggish once
                                    you tune it right, but it will also perform a lot better for filming indoors, around
                                    people, or in close quarters.</p>
                                <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../assets/img/drone-prop.jpg"
                                        alt="An FPV drone prop" /></figure>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Action Camera Capabilities?</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">As I previously said, the main reason for choosing these quads over
                                    others is for the filming capabilities. If you are new to the FPV world, don’t
                                    expect the camera you use to fly with to film anything worthwhile. You’ll need to
                                    find a suitable action camera to mount on your quad. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">There are several brands that will do the trick, but two of the
                                    most popular brands are Insta 360 and GoPro. My personal favorite is the GoPro Hero
                                    10 Black Bones. It is the lightest GoPro (2022) and runs power from your quad’s
                                    battery. Whatever model you choose, you'll want something that's light and films
                                    high quality. Otherwise, your drone won't be able to fly well under the weight or
                                    won't be capturing anything that's quality. </p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Where to find camera mounts?</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Some pilots choose to design their own action camera mounts and
                                    have them 3D printed. They do this either out of necessity or for greater
                                    customization. You can usually find a good mount for your specific model on Etsy.
                                    There are several businesses out there now that focus on printing these parts and a
                                    quick Google search will come up with some great options. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Another common website is <a
                                        href="https://www.yeggi.com/q/gopro+fpv/">Yeggie.com</a>. There, you can find 3D
                                    models
                                    that other pilots have put together to either print yourself or order from a vendor
                                    to be printed. This can be a helpful resource if you aren't a good designer and

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">One piece of advice if you choose to 3D print your own parts: use
                                    TPU. If you haven’t gotten into the 3D printing world, then know that there are
                                    several different types of material you can use for this. TPU is recognized as the
                                    best for its elasticity and resilience. </p>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">A cinewhoop comes in just about any size as freestyle quads. Large
                                    quads, often referred to as “lifters” seem to be the one exception to this rule. I
                                    haven’t seen anyone build or sell a ducted quad that large as of the writing of this

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Just because you can safely fly around people, cars, pets, etc -
                                    doesn’t mean that you should! Pilots should be aware of the <a
                                        href="https://www.faa.gov/uas">FAA's Regulations</a> around
                                    drone use in general for the safety of everyone and also to protect this industry
                                    and hobby. It only takes a few idiotic incidences with drones to cause a tidal wave
                                    of governmental restrictions for drone pilots. So please, fly responsibly.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Here are a few important regulations to know about:</p>
                                <ul class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                    <li>Don’t fly around airports</li>
                                    <li>Don’t fly in national parks</li>
                                    <li>Any drone weighing over .55 pounds must be registered with the FAA</li>
                                    <li>Remote ID - this is a new law passed in 2022 that will require pilots to provide
                                        their location while flying. Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/lFgR0pP_fjE">this
                                            video</a> for more information. </li>
                                </ul>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">How to fly</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">If you’ve never flown FPV before, then you can expect to crash your
                                    drone into something or someone and break it on day 1. The controls are difficult to
                                    master and require a lot of practice. Most pilots will say that the best thing you
                                    can do to start is to buy a transmitter and practice on a <a
                                        href="https://www.velocidrone.com/">Virtual Simulator</a>.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">These virtual simulators are pretty good at mimicking what it’s
                                    like to fly in real life and will get you close enough to be able to fly in the real
                                    world. You should not move away from the simulator until you are satisfied with your
                                    abilities to fly virtually.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">You will still probably crash - that’s just the name of the game
                                    when it comes to FPV drones. However, most issues are easy enough to fix if your
                                    quad breaks. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">You should know that there are three flight modes: horizon, angle,
                                    and acro. Horizon is the easiest to start with and often the most useful for
                                    cinewhoops because it keeps your quad horizontally level. </p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Price Comparison</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">When compared with BNF models that have exposed props, cinewhoop
                                    drones don’t seem to incur any premium. The average price of a digital model for
                                    either type comes out to around $350 for a digital version of 3” quad.</p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Final Thoughts On Style Choice</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">If you aren't planning on flying indoors or close to people, then a
                                    cinewhoop might not be the right option for you. Freestyle drones enjoy greater
                                    speed and power, as well as a simpler design to maintain. A good decision on which
                                    drone to get really depends on your purpose for flying. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">On the other hand, you opt to go with both! It's not uncommon for
                                    FPV pilots to have several different quads instead of relying on just one. The
                                    initial buy-in to FPV is big. After that, it's not too expensive to begin adding to
                                    your drone collection over time.</p>
