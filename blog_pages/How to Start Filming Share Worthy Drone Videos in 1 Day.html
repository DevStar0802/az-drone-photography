                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In this article I’m going to show you how to start filming drone
                                    videos that people actually want to watch. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">When I upgraded to the DJI Spark 5 years ago, I was pumped to start
                                    filming something amazing with what was a high-quality drone camera at the time.
                                </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">However, I quickly realized that just because it was cool to fly a
                                    drone, that didn’t mean that what I was capturing was necessarily worth watching.
                                </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Several upgrades later, I found a strategy to making drone videos
                                    that were interesting every time. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I call this the Trench Run Technique. </p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Trench Run Technique</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The idea behind this name comes from Star Wars. In the movie,
                                    there’s a scene where Luke Skywalker flies his ship down the trench of the death
                                    star to destroy it and save the day. </p>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> It’s one of the most iconic and exciting parts of the film. I’ll
                                    explain more how this ties into the actual technique later on, but that’s the type
                                    of flying we are aiming for.</p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">From Boring to Brilliant</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Have you ever driven out somewhere with the intention of filming a
                                    killer drone video that turned out to be nothing special? </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">You can have the best scenery in the world and it won’t do anything
                                    for you unless you can film it properly. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> I had this issue where I would take the time to travel someplace
                                    remote and scenic, setup my drone, and then launch it out there and hit record.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Though it felt like what I was capturing was quality stuff,
                                    watching the video on my computer afterwards was usually a disappointment.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> However, the Trench Run Technique helped me start filming videos I
                                    actually wanted to share with people. I learned what to avoid and what to make sure
                                    to include in every video I took.</p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">5 Steps to Filming Drone Videos</h2>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Here are the 5 steps to using the Trench Run Technique: </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                <ul class="fs-5 fw-bold">

                                    <li>Step 2: Make a specific movement</li>

                                </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> That's it! Keep reading to learn how to apply this technique to
                                    your own videos.</p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Step 1: Identify a subject for your video</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Perhaps the most important thing that you can do to improve your
                                    drone videos is to identify a specific subject that you want to film.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Videos are most interesting when they tell a story, and the first
                                    part of any story is a subject.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Picking a subject can help you to create a story out of what would
                                    be a meaningless video. This subject can be a person, a building, a car, a mountain
                                    – it doesn’t really matter what it is, just pick something!</p>

                                    title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
                                    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                                    allowfullscreen class="youtube-video"></iframe>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In this video, the subject is clearly the cabin and that's what
                                    your eyes focus on. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">You can also have multiple subjects in the same video, but I prefer
                                    to start off with one prominent subject. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Now, with your subject in mind, you will automatically be drawn to
                                    that thing when you are flying and film more of it. Your subject will be the main
                                    focus of your video and should be the place where your eyes naturally look to. </p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Step 2: Plan a specific movement with your drone's
                                    camera</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><a href="./Beginners Guide to FPV Part 1.html">FPV</a> pilots
                                    should pay extra attention to this step. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">You want to add a specific movement to your video to help with the
                                    story telling. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Think about Luke Skywalker blowing up the Death Star. He entered
                                    the trench with his fellow pilots, flew through the laser turrets, and launched his
                                    proton torpedo into the port hole to blow the whole thing up! </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">It would make for a much less interesting story if Luke had shot at
                                    the Death Star while hovering several miles away in his ship. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Adding a planned movement will make whatever you are filming even
                                    more interesting.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For example, let’s say that my subject was a mountain. For my
                                    specific movement, I could fly down the side of the mountain and turn my drone
                                    around at the end capture my subject with a beautiful skyline. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Another example: my subject this time is a building. Pay attention
                                    specifically to the movements in this video:</p>
                                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3sE1LdscCNw?si=H5Cykc8fBIa4hmRN"

                                    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                                    allowfullscreen class="youtube-video"></iframe>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Notice how you can combine different movements such as moving the
                                    gimbal up while flying forward, or increasing the altitude while flying backwards.
                                    One movement is often enough for good footage, but combining two or three well in
                                    one shot is gold. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                    The key here is decide what you are going to do beforehand that will capture a
                                    viewers attention toward your subject. </p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Step 3: Smooth movements</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This seems like a simple step, but it’s absolutely critical to
                                    create a
                                    quality video. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Jerky camera movements distract viewers from your subject and
                                    story, disconnecting them entirely from your video. It's just not enjoyable to
                                    watch. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> FPV drones like <a
                                        href="./Everything You Need To Know About A Cinewhoop.html">cinewhoops</a> can
                                    especially make a lot of jittery,
                                    abrupt movements. Be sure to fly every movement as smooth as you possibly can. Every
                                    small course correction will show up when you edit your footage.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Additionally, remember to film for about twice as long as you think
                                    a shot should take. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For whatever reason, many pilots cut off the shot too quick and the
                                    full effect of the subject or scenery is diminished. </p>

                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Step 4: Begin your recording early on</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Another simple step but an important one. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Start recording well before you think you need to. When you get
                                    back to your computer afterwards for editing, you can always cut out the excess.
                                </p>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> What you want to avoid is missing anything important.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Before a flight, remember to check your memory capacity for this. I
                                    always make more space than I think I'll need on my memory cards. </p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Step 5: Expose properly</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Exposing your video is a huge step!</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Even if you get everything else right, this one step can still ruin
                                    your perfectly executed drone video. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Spend the extra time to dial this in just right. If you don’t know
                                    how to adjust exposure correctly, then you should definitely do some research on
                                    YouTube to learn how. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> There’s just no way you will be able to get the quality of videos
                                    you want without this skill.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Also, be sure to watch out for those highlights when adjusting the
                                    exposure. Something bright like the sun shining off a building or a white wedding
                                    dress can still look over exposed in the final footage when the rest of the scene
                                    looks fine.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Pay attention to the exposure in this video. Notice when areas look
                                    too bright or too dark as the drone progresses. </p>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Even though there may be some tricky lighting you always want to
                                    ensure that your camera is properly exposed for the subject. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">That typically means setting the exposure to a fixed value instead
                                    of auto exposing like this video does. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> I recommend when in doubt to underexpose (reasonably!) so that you
                                    can brighten up the whole scene later in your editing.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This is much easier to do than trying to correct a part of the
                                    scene that was overexposed. </p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Try this technique yourself</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> That's all the steps you need to use the Trench Run Technique to
                                    start filming share worthy videos immediately.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I suggest you follow these 5 steps on every drone video you make
                                    and compare the results. </p>
