                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">If you haven’t made the jump already to using 3d tours in your
                                    listings, this article may help to convince you. Technology is always advancing.
                                    Those who stay up to date with it are able to leverage the benefits (and by
                                    benefits, we of course mean $) in their businesses. Virtual Tours are one of the
                                    hottest new technologies for the real estate industry. The following five reasons
                                    are sure to give you that push you need to adopt them with your clients. </p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">1.) Buyers are requesting them</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">According to a <a
                                        href="https://www.zillow.com/research/digital-tools-millennials-29101/">study</a>
                                    performed by Zillow® in 2021, the most requested digital tools by home buyers
                                    shopping online were 3d virtual tours and the ability to view a digital floor plan.
                                    Big hint for doing any kind of business: give the people what they want! Real estate
                                    agents should be taking advantage of this trend to get in front of more clients</p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">2.) The property stands out</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Related to the first point – people want virtual tours, so give
                                    them virtual tours. Doing so will attract potential buyers to your listing over one
                                    that doesn’t have tours. Virtual tours take several minutes to click through, so
                                    they ensure that more time and attention is being spent on your listing. Plus, they
                                    just look really cool and are fun to use!</p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">3.) Less time is wasted on non-buyers</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Arguably, the biggest buying-decision moment happens when the new
                                    potential owners take that first step in the front door. 3d tours allow you to
                                    extend that experience virtually. This will help increase the efficiency of the
                                    buying process and reduce the time that a home is on the market. </p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">4.) They are great marketing material</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">A simple enough point! They do look fantastic, and everyone likes
                                    to “ooh” and “ahh” over a beautiful home. Another way to get more people looking at
                                    your properties and at yourself as an agent. When you show you are using virtual
                                    tours, it gives the impression to others that you are a serious agent and don’t cut
                                    corners when it comes to selling. </p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">5.) You can show off more features</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Unless you upload hundreds of photos, there’s just no way to show
                                    off all the angles you’d like to. Providing a virtual tour solves that problem for
                                    you. They help the client take in every detail and better imagine themselves living
                                    there. </p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Additionally, Matterport® virtual tours create a 3d twin of your
                                    property that allows you to zoom out to look at the property as a whole. You can
                                    even make accurate measurements within the virtual tour for those who like to see
                                    the numbers. </p>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Start with 3d tours</h2>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Hopefully, you’ve seen how investing in virtual tours can help your
                                    publicity and sales. If you have questions about how to use virtual tours, see this
                                    guide on the subject. Alternatively, you could ask your local real estate
                                    photographer. They likely will be able to guide you in the process. </p>
